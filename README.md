# William Greenwood's Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! I am a third year computer science student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

I am currently teaching myself Python and exercising my skills by focusing on projects in this language specifically. Some other projects here might be from previous lab classes programmed in C and C++.


## Projects

### [Custom Shell](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/portfolio/tree/main/custom-shell) - Supports resource limits, internal and external commands, environment variable expansion, file redirection. This project uses a vector library created by my professor, available in a public repository, and uses Linux systems programming techniques. Developed in C for COSC 360: Systems Programming.

### [Sorting Visualizer](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/portfolio/tree/main/sorting-visualizer) - Visualization for bubble, insertion, selection, shell, merge, quick, and heap sort. Created using Python and the Matplotlib library.

### [Taylor Series Visualizer](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/portfolio/tree/main/taylor-series-visualizer) - Visualization that incrementally graphs a user-provided function through its 10th degree Taylor polynomial. Created using Python and matplotlib, NumPy, SymPy libraries.

### Graph Isomorphism Detector (coming soon) - Designed to detect isomorphisms between two graphs using a custom-built graph library in Python.
