# William Greenwood's Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! I am a third year computer science student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

I am currently teaching myself Python and exercising my skills by focusing on projects in this language specifically. Some other projects here might be from previous lab classes programmed in C and C++.


## Projects

### [Custom Shell]() - supports resource limits, internal and external commands, environment variable expansion, file redirection; developed in C for COSC 360: Systems Programming.

### [Sorting Visualizer](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/portfolio/tree/main/sorting-visualizer) - visualization for bubble, insertion, selection, shell, merge, quick, and heap sort; created using Python and the Matplotlib library.

### [Taylor Series Visualizer](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/portfolio/tree/main/taylor-series-visualizer) - visualization that incrementally graphs a user-provided function through its 10th degree Taylor polynomial; created using Python and matplotlib, NumPy, SymPy libraries.

### Graph Isomorphism Detector (coming soon) - designed to detect isomorphisms between two graphs using a custom-built graph library in Python.
