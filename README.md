# William Greenwood's Portfolio

## *This is an old repository. Projects have been moved to individual repos (linked below) and are no longer updated in this portfolio.*

### [Graph Library](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/graph-library) *(Python, Matplotlib, NumPy)*
* Custom graph library supporting various representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix, and edge list) for both undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted graphs
* Features and algorithms include:
    * Traversals: Breadth-first and Depth-first search
    * Pathfinding: Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
    * Minimum spanning trees: Kruskal’s Algorithm and Prim’s Algorithm
    * Graph analysis: component counting, cycle detection, Eulerian graph detection
    * Graph generation for complete, complete-bipartite, and cycle graphs for an arbitrary order n
    * Basic visualization tools to display graphs using matplotlib

### [Sorting Visualizer](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/sorting-visualizer) *(Python, Matplotlib)*
* Interactive tool to visualize sorting algorithms, including bubble, insertion, selection, shell, merge, quick, and heap sort

### [Taylor Series Visualizer](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/taylor-series-visualizer) *(Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, SymPy)*
* Tool to dynamically graph functions using Taylor polynomial approximations up to the 10th degree

### [Custom Shell](https://github.com/wgreenwood4/portfolio/tree/main/custom-shell) *(C)*
* Assignment for COSC 360- Systems Programming (University of Tennessee)
    * Was built off a professor's custom C vector library
    * Future goals include creating my own library for this project to run off of
* Unix-like shell supporting resource limits, internal/external commands, environment variable expansion, and file redirection
